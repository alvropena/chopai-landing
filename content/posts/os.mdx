Open Source represents the future of software development. As technical barriers fall thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a democratization of software development that empowers more people to become builders. At our core, we are dedicated to contributing to this movement by making our code publicly available, which serves as a fundamental principle of accountability and community-driven innovation.

While tech giants have historically built closed systems to monopolize markets, we envision a different future—one where innovation is driven by community collaboration rather than market control. We're particularly excited to see educators, psychologists, scientists, communicators, and artists leveraging AI to create solutions that address real-world challenges.

According to the Open Source Initiative, Open Source software is code that can be freely accessed, studied, and modified by anyone. Beyond accessibility, it must allow free redistribution and ensure no discrimination against persons or fields of use. In education, this transparency is crucial—users must know how their data is handled and how they are being taught, breaking away from traditional institutional gatekeeping.

More than a decade ago, Ivy League institutions took the bold step of sharing their curricula online, proving that quality education need not be confined by institutional walls. We believe software must embrace this same spirit of openness. Therefore, in the coming weeks, we will make our first algorithm, 'Pink,' publicly available.
