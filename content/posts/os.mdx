Open Source represents the future of software development. As technical barriers fall, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, we are witnessing a democratization of software development that empowers more people to become builders. At our core, we are dedicated to contributing to this movement by making our code publicly available, which serves as a fundamental principle of accountability and community-driven innovation.

While tech giants have historically built closed systems to monopolize markets, we envision a different future—one where innovation is driven by community collaboration rather than market control. We are particularly excited to see educators, psychologists, scientists, communicators, and artists leveraging AI to create solutions that address real-world challenges.

According to the Open Source Initiative, Open Source software is code that can be freely accessed, studied, and modified by anyone. Beyond accessibility, it must allow free redistribution and ensure no discrimination against persons or fields of use. In education, this transparency is crucial—users must know how their data is handled and how they are being taught, breaking away from traditional institutional gatekeeping. MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative proved this by democratizing elite education for hundreds of millions worldwide.

Some may view open-sourcing educational software as a business risk, concerned that transparency could compromise competitive advantage. However, we see it differently. As pioneers in AI-powered education, we understand that true innovation isn't about keeping code behind closed doors; it's about fostering a community that continuously pushes the boundaries of what's possible. In this rapidly advancing field, leadership comes not from secrecy but from the courage to remain at the forefront of innovation while empowering others to build upon our foundation.

Join us in building the future of learning.
