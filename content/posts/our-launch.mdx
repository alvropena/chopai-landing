We're thrilled to announce that Chop is officially available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chop-ai/id6739903784)! This launch marks a significant milestone in our mission to make learning more engaging and accessible for everyone.

As we work on rolling out our Android version in the coming weeks, we want to take this moment to celebrate this new chapter with you. Together, we can reshape the future of learning, and we can't wait to share our vision with you.

## Key Features of Chop

In this initial version of Chop, we've focused on three main features:

### Great Software

In the last decade, the language learning market has seen several platforms rise to prominence, revealing a strong demand for effective language education. However, many users have settled for these options due to a lack of truly exceptional alternatives. At Chop, we are dedicated to changing that.

For our launch, we are prioritizing language learning as a core focus. Chop is designed to be a community-driven platform. Currently, we've unlocked Italian as our first community, but we're thrilled to announce that more languages will be added shortly. You can look forward to the rollout of over 100 communities in the coming weeks, as this is our top priority for Q1 2025.

### Learning Identity

We're excited to offer users their first taste of our learning experience by allowing them to create personalized profiles. Your Chop profile will be used to tailor the learning experience to your needs. For instance, if you are a beginner in a language, you will see content specifically designed for your level, enabling you to track your progress over time and share that progress with your friends.

Chop won't be your personal tutor; we believe that this concept as the solution to learning is limiting. No matter how many private tutors a wealthy individual has, they won't be able to install knowledge directly into your brain; that work must come from you. Hence, we envision Chop as the ideal playground for self-directed learning.

We believe that in the future, users will visit each other's Chop profiles much like developers do on GitHub, serving as a measure of commitment to a topic. It will be a badge of honor to be a top contributor in a community. Because of this, we encourage you to spend as much time as possible in the communities that interest you.

### Community Features

Our community system is designed to enhance the collaborative and social aspects of learning on Chop, fostering connections among users.

We believe this initial version of Chop is the simplest yet most effective launch we could have achieved, and it took immense effort to get here. We hope you enjoy it and are eager to see where we take the product in the future.

## Upcoming Features

Here is what you can expect in the coming weeks:

* **Localization**: Currently, Chop is available only in English. Localizing the app to support multiple languages is our top priority, ensuring that everyone, no matter what language they speak, can learn anything.
* **Unlocking 100+ Communities**: As mentioned earlier, our primary focus during Q1 will be on language learning until the end of March. After that, we'll unlock access to hundreds of communities covering a wide range of topics, including science, sports, art, music, and more.
* **Search**: We'll introduce a feature that allows users to search for one another, fostering a sense of community within our platform. This social aspect will enhance the learning experience, just as the true value of traditional education lies in its social interactions rather than just content. Chop will be the digital version of the school playground.
* **Pro Version**: While Chop will always be a free and open-source platform, we're excited to announce the upcoming launch of our pro version with additional features. The main benefit of the pro version will be the ability to make mistakes without limitations. Other benefits will include an ad-free experience and the ability to have a custom profile.
* **One-Time Purchases**: For those who prefer not to commit to a subscription, we will also offer one-time purchases for additional lives when needed.

We're excited about the future. Thank you for being part of this journey!
