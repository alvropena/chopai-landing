## Introduction

Today, Chop got accepted in the App Store.

The Android version is coming in the following weeks.

But we want to take a moment to celebrate this new chapter with you all.

Here are the three main features we've focused on for the first version of Chop:

## State of the Art

### Focus on Language Learning
We've identified a huge demand in language learning. We believe the applications in the EdTEch niche are not striving to make learning as it should be. We will.

### User Profiles
We're giving users their first taste of the Chop experience by allowing them to create personalized profiles and explore the platform's features.

### Community Features
We've introduced how our community system works, showcasing the collaborative and social aspects of learning on Chop.

We think this initial version of Chop is the simplest we could've launched with, but it took a lot of work to get here. We hope you like it and are interested in seeing where we take the product in the future.

## What's next?

In the next following weeks, we'll be rolling out the following features:

- We'll add localization to the app. As of now, Chop is only available in English. We are making a top priority to localize the app to as many languages as possible.
- We'll be unlocking 100 communities for you to learn. Just like I mentioned above, we'll be focusing on languages during Q1, until the end of March, then we'll unlock Chop to thousands of communities from the biggest variety of topics: science, sports, art, music, etc.
- We'll be allowing users to follow one another. This way we will build a community inside our platform. Each user will be able to follow others and be followed. We have big plans to make learning a social experience and we are very excited to share this with all of you, please stay tuned.
- We'll be launching the pro version of Chop. By the time I'm writing this we are allowing users to learn as much as they want free forever. Chop will always be a free platform, but we will be launching a pro version with extra features. In the pro version you will have: infinite lives, no ads, and more. At the beginning the subscription will mostly be focused on giving you endless learning with lives and making infinite mistakes, if you don't pay for the subscription, once your lives are over, you'll have to wait 24 hours to keep learning. All users begin with 20 lives on their account.
- As well as our pro version we will be launching one-time purchases. If you don't want to commit to a subscription, you can purchase lives once they are over.
- We'll be working on the focused session learning. Right now, Chop is inspired on platforms like TikTok where we have a main feed of cards, there you will be able to see all the cards from the courses you are interested in. Yet, if you want to do a focused learning session, you'll be able to do it by joining a community.
